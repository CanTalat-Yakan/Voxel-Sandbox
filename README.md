## Overview

The 3D Engine is currently in an early stage of development and is not yet equipped with the essential features required for a production-ready game engine. 
However, a clear and forward-looking development roadmap has been established, with active work being done to implement advanced systems such as virtualized geometry and radiance cascades for fully dynamic global illumination.
As development progresses, I plan to foster a community starting next year, with the aim of building a C# game engine that integrates seamlessly with Unity workflows. 
With your support, we can create a powerful and user-friendly engine, complete with an editor, that meets the demands of modern game development.
